Since Nv driver is already installed, do not select any Display/Graphics/OpenGL option in the cuda installer. Only install the CUDA toolkit and samples.

For 16.04.1, also need to run the Patch file - cuda_8.0.27.1_linux.run, to enable support for GCC5

For building CUDA, some Makefiles have hardcoded versions of NVIDIA driver, so manually needs to be changed to the current version (ex NVIDIA-367). Also, GLU and other support packages are required for GL / visualisation samples.

An example output of CUDA sample app is below:

NOTE:

Set the PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH for cuda. Below can be used as reference.

source ~/setup_paths.sh

where, setup_paths.sh contains like below:

export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
